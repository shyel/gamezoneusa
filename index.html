                <h1>Welcome to Game Zone</h1>
                <p>Game Zone is one of the oldest video game stores in the Phoenix area owned and operated by the Mazak family.</p>
                <p>In 1996, Nintendo's newest console at the time was the N64! Game Zone was there to provide the gaming community with this newest edition to the Nintendo family and as years went on Game Zone would continue selling the latest and hottest systems and games.</p>
                <p>Today, the products have expanded into other areas from collectible figures to plush toys and candy!</p>
                <p>And yes... when we have them, we still sell the N64.</p>
